# FACEMASK DETECTION SYSTEM: FRONTEND APPLICATION

This repository is part of a solution that addresses the problem of enforcing COVID-19 face mask mandates. The Facemask Detection System will be implemented as a Web Application that is accessible through a web browser on a personal computer. 
This is the front end application of the solution. It is a React web application that is intuitively easy-to-use for non-technical and computer illiterate users. The solution will take a human-centred design approach that emphasises usability and beautiful design for easy usage.
